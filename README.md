# Helmet Detection using CNN Model

![Helmet Detection Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview

This project aims to enhance safety in workplaces and construction sites by developing a helmet detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to identify whether a person is wearing a helmet or not, contributing to the prevention of head injuries and accidents.

The core of the system is a CNN model trained on a dataset of annotated images containing people with and without helmets. The model learns the distinctive features of helmets and human faces, allowing it to accurately predict whether a helmet is present in a given image.

## Features

- **CNN Model:** We've trained a deep learning CNN model using state-of-the-art techniques. This model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in detecting helmets in various settings and angles.

- **Dataset:** Our dataset is collect from Kaggle.

- **Real-time Detection:** The trained model can perform real-time helmet detection on images  making it suitable for integration into surveillance systems or mobile applications.
